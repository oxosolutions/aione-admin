PLEASE DO NOT POST!  PLEASE READ!  

If you are using a theme or a plugin that includes Redux Framework, we are unable to offer any kind of support.

Why?  Well, Redux is a tool for developers to include an options panel in their project. Consequently, we do not and are not able to offer support for folks who have purchased a theme or plugin that uses Redux Framework. The responsibility of support for themes and plugins befalls upon its author. 

The reason is simple.  Each theme/plugin author integrates Redux is different ways.  We have no way of knowing how these authors are using Redux in their projects.  The project and the code belongs to them.  The author must be the individual to support their work.  It is their responsibility to debug any problems or issues that arise with their work.  If the author makes the determination the issue rests with Redux Framework, then it is them who must come to us and file an issue.  That is when we will be able to look into an issue more closely.

We realize that some authors have included support links for Redux in their projects, when they should not have. We do apologize for that confusion and are taking steps to remedy this confusion. 

If you have purchased a theme or plugin that utilizes Redux, please contact the author for support. If the author is unavailable for support or has discontinued support, please refer to this before posting to our issue tracker: https://docs.reduxframework.com/core/support-defined.  In extreme cases where support from the author is impossible, we might be able to help you with a premium support purchase: https://reduxframework.com/extension/premium-support.  That service is not free.  Please read the terms on that page carefully.

Because of these policies, we will no longer be able to answer the influx of these types of issues individually.  They will be closed without reply.  We're sorry about this and apologize for this inconvenience.

Please refer to your theme/plug documentation now how to contact the author for support.

Thank you.  Good luck!
